1) Extensive experience in the development of systems of different classes. Complete understanding of the technology stack. Technologies and frameworks that I use (used in my work): iOS (Swift, RxSwift, Realm, Alamofire, Firebase, etc.), Android (Java, Kotlin, Retrofit2, Koin, Toothpick (instead of dagger), Firebase, etc.) ... On Android, I completely switched to Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel, Room, DataBinding, WorkManager, Navigation, etc.) in my development. I sincerely believe that following the recommendations of the "vendor" is the key to success (I have repeatedly made sure of this with the support of my "multimedia" applications). Kotlin + Coroutine made it possible to drop RxJava. The main patterns used are MVVM and Viper. In Android, the advent of Navigation has nicely solved the technical problem of routing between screens. Using "ribs", "epoxy", "conductor", etc. instead of "Architecture Components" on Android is considered a gross architectural mistake.

2) Extensive experience in the design of information systems as an Architect of software systems. Architectural patterns, microservices, breaking "hard" links between modules and subsystems, and how all this affects a quality product I know in "practice". I know how to do the "correct" integration with external systems.

3) Expert in JAVA-Enterprise ECM and BPM systems on IBM Filenet, Alfresco, Documentum, Camunda platforms (I consider Camunda to be the best bpm-engine implementation). Currently, all applications that are developed with my participation and guidance are developed in Java Spring Boot, delivery in the form of docker images.

4) Product and project management, including in the role of a product manager (not only development, but also promotion) But my experience shows that it is the "right" one that makes the greatest contribution to the creation of the "right" quality product within the allotted time frame and budget. architecture, and its implementation in "code". Naturally, under competent project management (I do not diminish the role of correct project management). Therefore, I am now an Architect & Developer.

Combination of qualities and experience: "Architect <-> Developer <-> Project Manager" gives you the opportunity to see the possible options to the fullest when choosing the best way to achieve the goal "Creating a quality product-solution", and after choosing the path and successfully achieve the intended goal. My experience gives me an understanding of "how to go" to get "where you need to".

Additionally about myself: I do not smoke, I like sports (in taekwondo - black belt).
